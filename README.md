# Analytics Portfolio

Welcome! This repository showcases a selection of coding work Iâ€™ve completed as part of my professional development and project-based learning. The goal is to demonstrate my technical skills and ability to apply analytics to solve real-world problems.

## ðŸ“Œ What You'll Find

### SQL
- Queries: This folder includes various standalone SQL queries developed to retrieve, filter, group, and summarize data. These examples range from basic SELECT statements to more advanced filtering, aggregation, and subqueries.
- Joins: Showcases examples of INNER JOIN, LEFT OUTER JOIN, RIGHT OUTER JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN. These files demonstrate how to combine data across multiple tables based on related keys, as well as scenarios for using different types of joins.
- Views: This folder includes scripts that define SQL viewsâ€”virtual tables created by storing SELECT query results. These examples demonstrate how to simplify complex queries, encapsulate logic for reuse, and improve readability by abstracting data retrieval.
- Procedures&Transactions: Contains stored procedures and transaction logic. These scripts demonstrate how to encapsulate SQL operations into reusable procedures and ensure data integrity using ACID-compliant transactions, including conditional logic, exception handling, and rollback operations.


## ðŸ§  Purpose
This repo is part of my ongoing learning in analytics. These files are examples from my professional accomplishments and completed coursework through Coursera and LinkedIn Learning. This space to practice and demonstrate those skills.
